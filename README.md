# cupp.py - Common User Passwords Profiler

 
## About

  The most common form of authentication is the combination of a username
  and a password or passphrase. If both match values stored within a locally
  stored table, the user is authenticated for a connection. Password strength is
  a measure of the difficulty involved in guessing or breaking the password
  through cryptographic techniques or library-based automated testing of
  alternate values.

  A weak password might be very short or only use alphanumberic characters,
  making decryption simple. A weak password can also be one that is easily
  guessed by someone profiling the user, such as a birthday, nickname, address,
  name of a pet or relative, or a common word such as God, love, money or password.

  That is why CUPP has born, and it can be used in situations like legal
  penetration tests or forensic crime investigations.
